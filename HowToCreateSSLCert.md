# How to create and setup an SSL Cert

If you host your webgl build on a https domain you will need to use wss which will require a ssl cert.

## pre-setup

- You need a domain name 
  - With dns record pointing at cloud server
- Set up cloud server: [How to set up google cloud server](https://mirror-networking.com/docs/Articles/Guides/DevServer/gcloud/index.html) 

> note: You may need to open port 80 for certbot

## Get Cert

Follows guides here:

https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/
https://certbot.eff.org/instructions

Find the instructions for your server version, below is link for **Linux**

https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=snap

### Running certbot

For instruction 6 run the `standalone` option 

```
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
```

⚠ **Unity Only**: Unity has a issue mono when using openSSL 3 certificate
```
sudo certbot certonly --standalone --key-type rsa
```

After filling in details you will get a result like this 

```
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/simpleweb.example.com/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/simpleweb.example.com/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2021-01-07. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"

```

`simpleweb.example.com` should be your domain

## Create cert.pfx

To create a pfx file that SimpleWebTransport can use run this command in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/simpleweb.example.com/` folder

```sh
openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.pfx -inkey privkey.pem -in cert.pem -certfile chain.pem
```

⚠ **Unity Only**: Unity has a issue mono when using openSSL 3 certificate
```sh
openssl pkcs12 -export -out cert.pfx -inkey privkey.pem -in cert.pem -certfile chain.pem -legacy
```
You will be asked for a password, you can set a password or leave it blank.

You might need to be super user in order to do this:

```
su

cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/simpleweb.example.com/
```

> Note: Currently the mono version shipped with unity is unable to load pfx files generated by OpenSSL version 3. You will have to add the -legacy command line argument to the openssl command above to generate a compatible pfx file.

## Using cert.pfx

You can either copy the cert.pfx file to your server folder or create a symbolic link

Move
```sh
mv /etc/letsencrypt/live/simpleweb.example.com/cert.pfx ~/path/to/server/cert.pfx
```

Symbolic link
```sh
ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/simpleweb.example.com/cert.pfx ~/path/to/server/cert.pfx
```

### create cert.json file

Create a `cert.json` that SimpleWebTransport can read

Run this command in the `~/path/to/server/` folder

If you left the password blank at cert creation:
```sh
echo '{ "path":"./cert.pfx", "password": "" }' > cert.json
```

If you set up a password "yourPassword" at cert creation:
```sh
echo '{ "path":"./cert.pfx", "password": "yourPassword" }' > cert.json
```

### Run your server

After the `cert.json` and `cert.pfx` are in the server folder like this
```
ServerFolder
|- demo_server.x86_64
|- cert.json
|- cert.pfx
```

Then make the server file executable
```
chmod +x demo_server.x86_64
```

To run in the active terminal use
```
./demo_server.x86_64
```


To run in background use
```
nohup ./demo_server.x86_64 &
```
> `nohup` means: the executable will keep running after you close your ssh session
the `&` sign means: that your server will run in background


> you may need to use `sudo` to run if you created a symbolic link

### Connect to your game 

Test everything is working by connection using the editor or a build 

set your domain (eg `simpleweb.example.com`) in the hostname field and then start a client

# Debug

To check if your pfx file is working outside of unity you can use [pfxTestServer.js](DebugScripts/node\~/pfxTestServer.js).

To use this install `nodejs` then set the pfx path and run it with `node pfxTestServer.js`

You should then be able to visit `https://simpleweb.example.com:8000` and have the server response (change port and domain to fit your needs)
